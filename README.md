# Rhitomata
A rhythm game üëç.

## What is this?

A rhythm game.

You won't see much even if you cloned it, we'll be building this out when we have a solid idea of what the revamp will be. But as for now, thank you for visiting the repository!

## Current plan

Still prototyping.

[Contact us (Discord)](https://discord.gg/Jg7ECbxttm) if you have any suggestion, feedback, or additional ideas that you think might be cool to include in this game!

## Requirements

- Unity 6000.0.51f1 (LTS)
- C# IDE/Code Editor (Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code + C# Extension/JetBrains Rider)

### üîì License Change

The project will become open-source under the following conditions:

- **If Rhitomata development is inactive for 2 consecutive years**, **or**
- **If total lifetime revenue exceeds $1000 USD** and the project continues to receive active support for at least 6 months thereafter

When this happens, the code will be **relicensed**:

- **By default, under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)**
- However, the original developer [**Rhitomaic**](https://github.com/ReDarkTechnology) reserves the right to relicense it under either the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or the [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) instead, based on what best serves the project and its contributors at that time.

All changes will apply retroactively to the codebase and will be announced publicly.

We Aim to make Rhitomata fully open-source once the project is sustainable and stable for long-term community development.
